# Git Stashing

Suppose you are Implementing a new feature for your product. Your code is in progress and suddenly a customer escalation comes because of this, you have to keep aside your new feature work for few hours.

You can't commit your code partial code and also cannot throw away your changes so you need some temporary storage, when you store your partial changes and later on commit it.

To stash an item (only applies to modified fiels not new files)

git stash is used to temporarily save changes in your working directory that you donâ€™t want to commit yet. It allows you to switch branches or pull in changes without losing your current work.

</code></pre>

or with a **custom message**
<pre><code>
git stash save "your message"
</code></pre>

</code></pre>

Apply latest stash
